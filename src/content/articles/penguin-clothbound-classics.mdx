# Penguin Clothbound Classics: The Art of Affordable Elegance

As of 2022, the Penguin Clothbound Classics have sold over six million copies worldwide—a testament to their widespread success as a collector's favorite. The series offers a perfect blend of beauty and affordability, appealing to both bibliophiles and casual readers alike.

The creation of the Penguin Clothbound Classics was inspired, in part, by the rise of the Kindle. When Jeff Bezos introduced the Kindle in 2007, the book publishing industry faced genuine fears about the future of physical books, particularly collectible editions. Would readers still invest in a beautifully crafted hardcover when a cheaper, more portable digital version was available?

In 2008, Coralie Bickford-Smith, a talented graphic designer at Penguin, had already laid the groundwork for what would become the Clothbound Classics. She designed Penguin’s Poems for Life, published on November 11, 2007—a stunning 416-page anthology of legendary poetry celebrating life. Despite its simple two-color palette, the book’s bold design radiated uniqueness. The cover featured a large tree with intertwining vines, its striking graphics overwhelming the layout in a way that left each word and letter to find its place organically. This distinctive style would soon become the hallmark of the Clothbound Classics.
Poems for Life was partly a collaboration with Waterstones, the popular UK bookstore chain. Following its release, Waterstones proposed creating a larger series of affordable yet collectable books in a similar design style. Affordable and beautiful—what’s not to love?

The result was the Penguin Clothbound Classics. By the end of 2024, the series had grown to include over 107 titles, each meticulously designed by Bickford-Smith in her signature minimalist, graphics-focused style. These hardcovers are bound in cloth, eschewing traditional dust jackets, which enhances their tactile and aesthetic appeal. Notably, no paperback versions of these designs exist—and likely never will—since the series is aimed squarely at collectors.

Retailing for approximately $15–$20, the series is an excellent entry point for anyone looking to build a beautiful library. Many titles are frequently available on sale or through promotions such as "Buy One, Get One 50% Off," making them even more accessible.
